# VFN-Travel
An airbnb-like website built for educational purposes.

## Project description:
It basically imitates AirBnb,HomeAway etc functionality. A user can search for rentals(hotels,houses,apartments,villas) with the help of various filters. He/She can then make a reservation (if he/she is already registered and logged in).He/She can also post a review of a listing if he/she has visited it.Providers can add listings(the property that they want to rent out through the website) and manage them.In order for a user to acquire provider "privileges" his registration must first be approved by the admin.The admin has access to all the users accounts.Each user has a profile(providers and the admin have profiles with more
options which allow them to do extra things.For example a provider can find a list with all his/her properties through his/her profile)
